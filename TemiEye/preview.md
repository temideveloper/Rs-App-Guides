# TemiEye
TemiEye is made as a security application for Temi robot with patrolling and live video feed capabilities. 

This application allows users to create routes from locations saved in the Temi robot and patrol the route created.


## Why should I use TemiEye?

Perhaps you are looking to improve and strengthen you security and surveillance capabilities within a building, you might be considering options such as hiring more personnel for patrol or increasing CCTV coverage. Now, TemiEye can also be a solution for you to consider. 

As an autonomous service robot, it is capable of surveillance round the clock. While being a cheaper alternative than increasing CCTV coverage, it is able to supplement the security team by periodically patrolling known blindspots and exploring potentially dangerous encounters without risking the wellbeing of any personnel.
